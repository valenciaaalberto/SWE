![Aleu](/dog.jpg)

*Hello, my name is Aleu. I am named after one of the dogs from the movie Bolto. Some fun facts about me is that I enjoy to go on walks, I am 13 years old in human years, like to bark at neighbors, and love my treats. Whenever I hear the prefix "trea," you can expect my tail to begin wagging. WOOF!!*
