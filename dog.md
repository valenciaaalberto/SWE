![Aleu](/dog.jpg)

*Hello, my name is Aleu. I am named after one of the dogs from the movie Bolto. I am a very friendly dog but am protective of my owners. That being said, I enjoy being petted by humans. Some fun facts about me are that I enjoy going on walks, I am 13 years old in human years, I like to bark at neighbors, and love my treats. Whenever I hear the prefix "trea," you can expect my tail to begin wagging. WOOF!!!*
